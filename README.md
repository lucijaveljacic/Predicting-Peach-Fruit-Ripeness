The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the use of Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms, as well as ROSE package for dealing with imbalanced data, and DALEX package for performing model explanations. The final goal was predicting peach ripeness based on one or more alternative parameters of choice (such as color, size, firmness, etc.).
